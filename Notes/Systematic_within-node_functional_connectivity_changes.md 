Atlas selection is a problematic step of functional connectivity studies. Problems include: Not knowing which is the best atlas for what purpose; dynamic nature of nodes and edges; and even fundamentally how to define the nodes. Typically nodes are defined as clusters of voxels that have correlated activity above an arbitrary threshold.

Big idea of this paper: Within-node connectivity, i.e. homogeniety of a node changes across tasks and subjects.
